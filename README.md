# TrackIt_iOS_App
This app is to be used to track the delivery of parcels. The idea is that a receptionist will be using the app to log the parcels he/she is sending and to keep track of the delivery status of each parcel. The app has a parcel list screen for viewing the list of parcels that have already been entered, an input screen for entering the details of new parcels, and an edit screen for viewing and updating the details of the parcel delivery.
